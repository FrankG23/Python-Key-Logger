# Python-Key-Logger
This project demonstrates event-driven input handling in Python using pynput. I implemented keyboard listeners with callback functions, buffered input in memory, and handled file writes in batches to reduce I/O overhead. It also includes clean exit handling and filtering logic to distinguish between character and special keys
